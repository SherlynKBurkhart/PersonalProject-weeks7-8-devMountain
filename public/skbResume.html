		STORIES ABOUT ME
		In Malcolm Gladwell's "Outliers", 2008, pp. 77-78, he has two intelligence test puzzles. Malcolm gives the answers to both. The first is simple and straight forward. The second is not. Malcolm couldn't figure it out.  I knew the answer because Malcolm gives the answer right under the puzzle, kind of hard not to see it.  What interests me is I wanted to know WHY the answer was the answer. I stopped my reading and spent the next 20-25 minutes figuring it out and succeeded.  I love puzzles. They relax me.
